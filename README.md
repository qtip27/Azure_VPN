## Overview

This solution demonstrates how to create a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection between an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using their native VPN Gateway services. This approach provides a secure and reliable tunnel for network traffic between the two cloud providers.

## Key Concepts

-   **Azure VPN Gateway:** A virtual network gateway that sends encrypted traffic across a public connection to a Microsoft Azure VNet.
-   **AWS VPN Gateway:** A virtual private gateway on the AWS side of your VPN connection.
-   **Virtual Network (VNet):** A representation of your own network in the cloud within Azure.
-   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
-   **IPsec/IKE:** A suite of protocols used to secure IP communications by authenticating and/or encrypting each IP packet of a communication session.
-   **Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN:** A secure connection between two networks, such as your corporate network and Azure, or in this case, between Azure and AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   An active **Azure subscription**.
-   An existing **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** with at least one subnet.
-   An active **AWS account**.
-   An existing **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with at least one subnet.

## Steps Involved

The article likely covers the following high-level steps:

1.  **Azure VPN Gateway Configuration:**
    -   Creating a Virtual Network Gateway in Azure.
    -   Creating a Local Network Gateway representing the AWS VPC.
    -   Creating a Connection between the Azure VPN Gateway and the Local Network Gateway.
2.  **AWS VPN Gateway Configuration:**
    -   Creating a Virtual Private Gateway in AWS.
    -   Attaching the Virtual Private Gateway to your VPC.
    -   Creating a Customer Gateway representing the Azure VNet.
    -   Creating a VPN Connection between the Virtual Private Gateway and the Customer Gateway.
3.  **Route Configuration:**
    -   Configuring Azure Route Tables to direct traffic destined for the AWS VPC through the VPN Gateway.
    -   Configuring AWS Route Tables to direct traffic destined for the Azure VNet through the Virtual Private Gateway.
4.  **Security Group/Network Security Group (NSG) Configuration:**
    -   Ensuring appropriate firewall rules are in place on both sides to allow necessary traffic.

## Considerations

When implementing this solution, consider the following:

-   **Performance:** VPN throughput can be affected by gateway SKUs and network latency.
-   **Cost:** Be aware of the costs associated with VPN Gateways and data transfer on both Azure and AWS.
-   **Redundancy and Availability:** Explore options for creating redundant VPN connections for higher availability.
-   **Security:** Ensure you are using strong IPsec/IKE policies.
